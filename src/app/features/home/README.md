# Home

This is an example of a feature folder which contains both its container component `Home.js` and child components `ExampleConnectedComponent.js`. You could move the child component into the main folder, if you prefer.

The folder contains its actions and reducer files all together in one place, as opposed to the separated `/app/actions` and `/app/reducers` standard that is often used in Redux projects. This is to make it easier to keep all related files in the same place and avoid searching through multiple directories.
